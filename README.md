# Fantasy-F1 Backend
Non-profit using public api data to create a f1 fantasy league just to
explore the idea and learn some new skills.

This is a spring boot application built using java 11.

This application will serve the requests of the angular front-end application as well as 
communicate with a mysql database. I will add a link to the front-end 
github project when I set one up. This project may also contain a fantasy
engine, a user accesscontrol service and some other things which I will
create and add over time.

The day I remove the localhost password from the repo is the day I
start taking this project seriouslty
